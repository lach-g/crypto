LINKUP -> USDT -> DAI ->BNB

USDT GOES TO 


DAI goes to:
BNB
BTC

what i need to do
------
- change the linked list that is returning from depth first search
- inside it instead of printing all the nodes that are being visited
only print the ones that are used in the final path
- 

Rule could be that if the node being visited has no edges and is not the 
node being looked for it should not be added to the path
